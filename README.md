Job 1: DNA base counting problem: Summarization Design Pattern

Spark’s mapPartitions() transformation can be used to implement the summarization design pattern, which is useful when you’re working with big data and you want to get a summary view so you can glean insights that are not available from looking at a localized set of records alone. This design pattern involves grouping similar data together and then performing an operation such as calculating a statistic, building an index, or simply counting.
